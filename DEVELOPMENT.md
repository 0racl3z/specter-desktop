Python/flask is not very opinionated and everything is possible. After reading (this)[https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/#the-structure] and (this)[https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/#the-structure] we decided for the "src-approach", at least the most obvious parts of it.

setup.py is not (yet) as complex as listed there and setup.cfg is not even (yet?!) existing.
If you see this to need some improvements, please make it in small steps and explain what the benefits of all of that.
